			<li><strong>System boundary</strong> - represented by a bordered box (e.g. Automation boundary)</li>
			<li><strong>Use case</strong> - represented by a labelled oval (e.g. Look up item availability, Create new order, Update order)</li>
			<li><strong>Communication association</strong> - represented by a line (with or without an arrow) connecting a use case and an actor</li>

		<h2>Detailed example: ATM</h2>

		<p>To illustrate the actor-based approach, let's walk through the approach for an ATM system.</p>

		<h3>Identify the system boundary</h3>

		<p>For an ATM, the system boundary is relatively clear: it is the machine itself. So when we create use cases, those use cases should be limited to the functionality of the machine.</p>

		<h3>Identify the primary actors</h3>

		<p>Since the ATM is our system boundary, what is outside of that boundary that interacts with the ATM? There are two clear answers: the customer and the bank.</p>

		<p>However, because the customer is always the one to initiate interactions with an ATM, the customer is the primary actor. The bank is a passive actor because it is involved in the interactions but never initiates any.</p>

		<h3>Identify the goals</h3>

		<p>What goals does a customer have when using an ATM? Two come to mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Check balances of accounts</li>
			<li>Manage money</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Identify the use cases</h3>
		<p>Next, we need to take the goals from the previous step and identify the use cases that can acheive those goals.</p>

		<p>We only need one use case to accomplish the <strong>Check balances of accounts</strong> goal:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Check balance</li>
		</ul>

		<p>However, to accomplish the <strong>Manage money</strong> goal, we'll need a few use cases:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Withdraw money</li>
			<li>Deposit money</li>
			<li>Transfer money</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Result</h3>
		<p>With the four-step actor-based approach, we identified the system boundary, two actors, and four use cases. With these identified, we can easily draw the use case diagram as such:</p>
