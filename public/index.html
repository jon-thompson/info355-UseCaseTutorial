		<h2>What is a use case?</h2>

		<p>A <strong>use case</strong> is unit of work performed by a system that an <a href="#actor">actor</a> uses. Each use case accomplishes a user goal. The complete set of use cases represents the entire functionality of that system.</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Good Examples</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Login</li>
				<li>Order item</li>
				<li>Withdraw money</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Bad Examples</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Type in password</li>
				<li>Click on item</li>
				<li>Enter PIN</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<section id="actor">
		<h2>What is an actor?</h2>

		<p>An <strong>actor</strong> is any person or other external entity that initiates a use case for the system.</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Good Examples</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Student</li>
				<li>Customer</li>
				<li>Bank</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3>Bad Examples</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The system itself</li>

			</ul>

		<h2>What is a use case diagram?</h2>

		<p>A <strong>use case diagram</strong> is a graphical representation of all the use cases in a given system. The diagram shows all the actors and use cases for the system and uses arrows to show the relationships among the actors and use cases.</p>

	<section id="use-case-specification">
		<h2>What is a use case specification?</h2>

		<p>A <strong>use case specification</strong> is a form of use case documentation. The specification provides additional details about the use case beyond its name. Depending on its level of detail, a use case specification may only be a few sentences or it could be several paragraphs worth of information organized in a large table. Each use case in a system should have its own specification.</p>
